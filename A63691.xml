            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He Encamped near <hi>Barnowar,</hi> not far from <hi>Darda,</hi> at a very narrow Paſs, having on the Right, a large Bogg; and on his Left, a Wood, with very thick Furs, and contrary to their Cuſtom he fortified his Camp ſo well, that he could not without great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105170:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->Difficulty be atrack'd in ſo advantageous a Poſt. And we having reaſon to fear that our Army being further diſtant, the Imperial Places on that ſide, might fall into the Hands of ſuch Potent Enemies, it was reſolv'd by all the Generals, to take the Gariſons out of them, the Cannons and the Ammunitions, and Demoliſh them. In order to it, our Army parted the 10th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> from the Camp, near <hi>Mohatz.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> took the Front with the right Wing towards <hi>Syclos,</hi> and his <hi>E. H.</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> followed in good Order with the left Wing. The next day, 11 of the ſame Month, we continu'd the ſame March in the preſenee of the Enemy, who by his continual At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, ſometimes upon the right Wing, ſometimes on the left, was endeavouring to hinder us from it; and we perſu'd it with great care on both ſides, to the foot of the Mountain <hi>Harſan,</hi> where we En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped all Night. The <hi>12th</hi> being St. <hi>Clara</hi>'s day, the Army March'd in good Order of Battalia towards <hi>Syclos.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Front again with his right Wing, the Enemy ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves coming out of a Wood, and endeavour'd to ſtop our March by continual Skirmiſhes; but we perceived well enough, that the Body of their Army by favour of the high Furs, was drawing towards our left Wing, and indeed we were ſoon convinc'd of it; for our left Wing had no ſooner paſs'd the Foreſt that was before it, and enter'd a Plain of three hundred Paces, or thereabout, but twelve thouſand of the beſt and fineſt Horſe of the Enemy came full Speed, and with great Fury fell upon our left Wing, with a deſign to put it into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by Attacking it in the Flank, and in the Rear; but their deſign having miſcarried by the vigorous Defence they found, and by the good Order which his <hi>E. H.</hi> had ſet every where, they went back as quick as they came. Soon after the Enemy attempted to pierce us by mere force; and in order to it, he cauſed his whole Army, compos'd of a 100000 Men, to advance and meet our left Wing, and 5000 <hi>Janizaries,</hi> took poſt upon a height near it, from whence they made a continual Fire upon us, and we plaid on both ſides with our Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot and Cannon, till near three of the Clock in the Afternoon. In the mean time, his <hi>E. H.</hi> took the Heroick Reſolution of Attacking the Enemy himſelf with his left Wing, having firſt reinforced himſelf with ſome Regiments he had deſired from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And he ſoon put it into Execution with a Courage beyond all Expreſſion, boldly carrying the Battalions and Squadrons to Fight, and encouraging them by his Voice and Example, ſo that that Wing alone, much inferior to the whole <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, fell bravely upon it, and after a moſt bloody Fight, forced it to abandon to us the Field of Battel. The Left ſtill purſuing the Enemy flying before us, to the Retrenchments of his Camp he had at his back, where by the favour of a Defily abovemention'd, which was lined and fill'd with <hi>Janizaries,</hi> he made a greater Reſiſtance: This did not hinder our Soldiers, encourag'd by the Example of the Heroick <hi>Maximilian,</hi> charging at the Head of them, and our whole left Wing from running under the Enemies Cannon with incredible Diligence, notwithſtanding their continual Fire.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105170:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->We paſs'd their Trenches, and chaſed the Enemies from their poſts; half an hour after, he made a halt, and took breath in another Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment larger than the firſt, but he made no great reſiſtance there: He was ſoon chas'd from it, and forced to fly in great Confuſion at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the whole Chriſtian Army, but we purſued him through his Camp as long as the light both of Day and Moon laſted, and as long as our Horſes could go.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Camp (as big almoſt as that before <hi>Vienna</hi>) all their Artillery conſiſting in a 100 Pieces of Cannon, and 12 Mortars, all their Ammunitions, Proviſions, Baggage, and all other things in great plenty fell into our hands, and there remained above 8000 Men of the Enemy dead upon the place of Battel, not reckoning thoſe that remained in the Boggs, or were drown'd in the Water, or thoſe that hid themſelves among the Furs, their Janizaries not having been able to follow, their horſe flying with all ſpeed. On our ſide we have loſt only ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Men: His Electoral Highneſs to his Immortal Glory has been wounded with one of the Janizaries Balls on the Left Hand. The Prince of <hi>Commercy,</hi> come that day to ſerve as Voluntier in the Left Wing, had the Top of his Breaſt pierced by an Arrow, and the young Count of <hi>Zinzendorf</hi> had his Leg ſhot off.</p>
            <p>His Electoral Highneſs has had for himſelf the Tent of the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, which is very Magnificent, and reſembles a Palace, being a quarter of a League round, with all the Moveables, and the whole Chancery, where were found Papers in all ſorts of Languages, and eſpecially a great number of Letters from <hi>Abaffi</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania:</hi> His Electoral Highneſs paſſed all the Night in that Tent, without lying down, writing almoſt continually; and by break of day he diſpatched Prince <hi>Engenius</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the next day <hi>Marqueſs Gabrieli</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi> of <hi>Beauvan</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> Collonel <hi>Sartory</hi> to <hi>Munick,</hi> and <hi>la Chaffon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery</hi> his Page to <hi>Cologne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 13th we went to ſearch into the Boggs and Furrs, the <hi>Turks</hi> hid there in great numbers, moſt were kill'd, and the reſt made Priſoners: We purſued alſo our flying Enemy, and made a detachment of 4000 Horſe, who advanced to <hi>Darda</hi> and even to the head of the Bridg of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> but could find none of them, and heard only that the Gariſon of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> ſeeing the flight of their fellow Soldiers, they had endeavoured to ſtop them, and for that effect had taken off ſome of the Boats that made the Bridg, but that nevertheleſs the flying men had got upon it with ſuch precipitation, they had thrown one another into the <hi>Drave,</hi> that the Bridg it ſelf had at laſt broke under them, and that ſeveral thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands had been drown'd: All this was confirm'd both by the Priſoners we took to the number of 1700, and by abundance of Deſertors that came into our Camp, aſſuring us, there was above Thirty thouſand Janizaries in the Ottoman Army, and that not above ſix or ſeven Thouſands had got ſafe on t'other ſide; from whence 'tis eaſie to conclude to what the loſs of the Enemy may amount, which is ſufficiently evidenced by that vaſt number of dead bodies wherewith the Ground, the Boggs, and the Furrs are filled. The G. Vizier, as ſaid, has very narrowly eſcaped by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105170:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->the means of a little Boat, but another too much loaded with Officers is periſh'd. The Remainder of the Enemies Army is diſpers'd and in Confuſion, and not able to keep the Field, having been forced to fly, and quit all they had of all kind. And no doubt, but That Almighty God that has ſo viſibly fought for Chriſtendom, has miraculouſly bleſſed the Imperial Arms; therefore to return God Thanks, his Electoral Highneſs cauſed the <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung in his Tent, which was that of the Grand Vizier; after that Father <hi>Marco</hi> had ſaid Maſs in it, the Enemies Cannon being diſcharged three times, all the Generals, and eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> came to Complement his Electoral Highneſs upon it, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted this Great Victory to the Bravery of the Great <hi>Maximilian.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> in his Relation to the Emperor, gives the ſame Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and attributes all the Glory of that day to his Electoral Highneſs, May the Almighty God long preſerve that Heroe, and always ſend new Victories to <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
